    The WOUnit framework contains a set of utilities for testing WebObjects applications using JUnit 4.7 or later.
    <P>
    Here is a simple test case written using WOUnit capabilities.
    <PRE>
import static com.wounit.EOAssert.*;

public class TestFoo {
   &#64;Rule
   public TemporaryEnterpriseObjectProvider provider = new TemporaryEnterpriseObjectProvider(&quot;FooModel&quot;);

   &#64;Test
   public void cantSaveWithNullProperty() {
      Foo foo = provider.createInstance(Foo.class);

      foo.setBar(null);

      confirm(foo, cannotBeSavedBecause(&quot;The bar property cannot be null&quot;));
   }
